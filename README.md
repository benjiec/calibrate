Calibration 
-----------

This is a simple tool that constructs a calibration curve using known x and y
values from standards, and backout the x value for an unknown based on its
measured y signal.

**Features**

 * Given x and y, creates calibration curve and finds linear portion and limits of linearity
 * Given y of an unknown, interpolates to find x
 * Computes interpolation error
